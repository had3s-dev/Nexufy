## Features âœ¨

With Downtify you can download Spotify music containing album art, track names, album title and other metadata about the songs. Just copy the Spotify link, whether it's a single song, an album, etc. As soon as your downloads are complete you will be notified!

## Music Sourcing

Downtify uses SpotDL to download music, which in turn uses YouTube as a download source. This method is used to avoid issues related to downloading music from Spotify.
